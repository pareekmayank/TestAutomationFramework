This is the selenium automation framework and is under construction
This is still usable but you need to expand this for your use
Clone the project on local machine and run the testng.xml - this will launch the two browsers in parallel and you can add as much files for feature file and automate the browsers and run them perallel
Framework is intigrated with ExtentReports to see the batter view of test execution
